The four regions--Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, and West--correspond to the U.S. regions recognized by the Census Bureau. Divisions and states included in the four regions are as follows:

Northeast:  New England Division (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and Middle Atlantic Division (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)

  <labl>Urban-Rural county classification</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults and sample children, URBRRL reports whether the household lives in a large central metro county, large fringe metro county, medium and small metro county, or nonmetropolitan county.

County Classification Scheme&nbsp;Counties are assigned to one of six levels according to the 2013 NCHS Classification Scheme, which are further collapsed to four levels in the NHIS public use files. The classification scheme "was developed for use in studying associations between urbanization level of residence and health and for monitoring the health of urban and rural residents." Users interested in more detail about how the classification scheme was developed and applied can see 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. Below is a brief description of how counties are categorized.

Counties designated as "Large central metro" are counties in MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas) with a population of 1 million or more that contain the entire population of the largest principal city, have their entire population in the largest principal city, or contain at least 250,000 inhabitants of any principal city of the MSA. "Large fringe metro" are counties in MSAs with a population of 1 million or more that do not qualify as large central metro counties. "Medium and small metro" are counties in MSAs with a population of less than 1 million. "Nonmetropolitan" are counties that are not in an MSA.After the 2019 redesign, there is no longer a sampling weight to produce household population estimates.

Prior to 2019, PERNUM numbers all persons within each family. Beginning in 2019, PERNUM numbers all person within a household and has a maximum of "2," as only the sample child and sample adult are identified in the original NHIS data. For more information, see the Comparability section.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files.  This weight should be used for many analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

  <labl>Sample Person Weight</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

  <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 
&nbsp;Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

  <txt><![CDATA[ASTATFLG identifies the record of a sample adult. A sample adult is the one person over age 18 per household who is randomly selected to complete the sample adult questionnaire. For 1997-2018, a sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)  Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

Prior to 2019, ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

For 2020 only, SALNGPRTFLG further distinguishes between sample adults included in the longitudinal sample and sample adults included in the partial sample. Please see the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information on the longitudinal and partial samples.

  <txt><![CDATA[For all persons, INCFAM97ON2 provides total grouped family income beginning in 1997, using income brackets introduced in 2007. Responses are reported in nominal dollars and have not been adjusted for inflation.
&nbsp;The 2007 NHIS introduced a recoded income bracket variable to bridge the differences between income brackets from 1997 to 2006 with those from 2007 forward. Individuals whose 1997 to 2006 total family income brackets ranged from "$0 to $4,999" to "$25,000 to $34,999", and those who had incomplete income information but reported that their total family income was "Less than $20,000", are grouped together as "$0 to $34,999." Individuals whose 1997 to 2006 total family income brackets ranged from "$35,000 to $44,999" to "$65,000 to $74,999" are grouped together as "$35,000 to $74,999." See the Codes tab for changes to top-coded income.

Those who had incomplete income information but reported that their total family income was $20,000 or more could not be incorporated into the new scheme and are coded separately.

Data users wishing to use the original income codes for this variable may use INCFAM9706 (Total combined family income, 1997-2006 grouping) and/or INCFAM07ON (Total combined family income, 2007+). See the drop down menu for additional related variables.]]></txt>
