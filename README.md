## Setup Instructions
1. One person from the group should:
    - Fork this repository by following instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). Make sure you rename it!
    - Add the other members of your team to the repository by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

2. All members of the group should then:
    - Sign in to Github and Github Desktop
    - Clone the forked repository to your local computer and open in Github Desktop by following the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).
    - Make a change to your local copy of the repo (e.g. add a test file), commit that change and then push to the master using the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop). Ignore the information about branches - for now you can just work on the main branch.
